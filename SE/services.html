                                <p style=text-align:justify>Threat Intelligence, is organized, analyzed and refined information about potential or current attacks that threaten an organization. The initial purpose of threat intelligence is to help a company understand the risks and threats of the most common and severe external or internal threats. The information collected helps companies understand the threats they are most vulnerable for and what they can do to protect themselves from damage.
                                    <br>
                                    <br>Understanding the threats that your company might face and how to prevent these attacks are crucial in today's digital environment. With hackers finding smarter ways to attack and threats harder to identify it is important to make sure you are protected at every level to secure, not only your information, but the information of your clients as well.</div>

                                <br><strong>Advanced Threat Protection (ATP)</strong> - Threats nowadays are more focussed and targeted with a huge amount of intelligence built into them. The unknown or zero-day threats are also of great concern to any enterprise. Grouping of more advanced defence mechanisms that can be centrally managed in order to obtain a holistic overview of the threats that are potentially targeting or threatening organizations.

                                        <br>
                                        <br><strong>NGAV does four, critical things to protect your business:</strong>
                                        <br>1 – Prevents commodity malware better than traditional AV
                                        <br>2 – Prevents unknown malware and sophisticated attacks by evaluating the context of an entire attack resulting in better prevention.
                                        <br>3 – Provides visibility and context to get to the root cause of a cyber attack and provide further attack context and insight.
                                        <br>4 – Remediate attacks.

                                        <br>A Firewall (whether this is host based or at the perimeter of a network) is required to protect the Endpoint from unauthorized access from other systems. Simply put, it builds a virtual wall with a set of specific controls that are implemented according to enterprise requirements. Intrusion Prevention Systems - IPS is an additional add-on that is normally a signature-based solution that can further protect endpoints against the more complex threats – the known and/or zero-day threats if the latest signature is available on the Endpoint.

                                    <br>The process of performing an authorized attack simulation on the information security infrastructure to exploit vulnerabilities and to provide a report containing a description of the vulnerabilities and the risk they may pose.
                                    <br>Penetration Testing can be divided into three main sections:
                                    <br>
                                    <div class=row>
                                        <div class=span3>
                                            <p style=text-align:justify><strong>White Box Testing:</strong>
                                                <br>The test implementer has full access to the information of the system being tested. White Box Testing ensures that the system is thoroughly tested. However, it does not simulate a true attack as the tester has information that would not be available to a true attacker.</div>
                                        <div class=span3>
                                            <p style=text-align:justify><strong>Black Box Testing:</strong>
                                                <br>The test implementer only makes use of information extracted as part of the attack to perform the test. This method simulates a more realistic attack scenario. The only disadvantage is the possibility of certain areas remaining untested.</div>
                                        <div class=span3>
                                            <p style=text-align:justify><strong>Grey Box Testing:</strong>
                                                <br>The test implementer only has access to specific information related to the system being tested.</div>
                                    </div><strong>Preventative Measures</strong>
                                    <br>
                                    <div class=row>
                                        <div class=span3>
                                            <p style=text-align:justify><strong>Vulnerability Management</strong>
                                                <br>An ongoing process that requires the output of the vulnerability assessments to commence with the process of remediation or mitigation of the vulnerabilities. Phases that can form part of the management of vulnerabilities can be:
                                                <br><strong>•</strong>Install the recommended patches or hotfixes
                                                <br><strong>•</strong>Upgrade to more recent versions of the software
                                                <br><strong>•</strong>Reconfigure software based on the recommendations from the scan results
                                                <br><strong>•</strong>Update or change configuration of perimeter defences
                                                <br><strong>•</strong>Ensure up to date IPS signatures in place
                                                <br>
                                        </div>
                                        <div class=span3>
                                            <p style=text-align:justify><strong>Perimeter Firewall</strong>
                                                <br>A system that has been designed to prevent unauthorized connections from entering or leaving the network as well as to provide monitors based on a specific set of controls. These systems can be found in different forms - either hardware or software based or a combination thereof.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>Traditional firewalls were designed with a simplistic approach to primarily allow, block or reject a connection if not specified in the controls. Next generation firewalls provide more granular controls, are based on intelligence and greater visibility on all the layers of the network stack.
                                                <br>

                                            <p style=text-align:justify><strong>Secure Remote Access</strong>
                                                <br>Remote access is crucial to any employee that needs to access corporate resources from remote locations and it is even more crucial to ensure that the access to their information is secure.
                                                <br>
                                                <br>Employees should also not be limited to certain device types (endpoint or mobile) and this should be an extension of the office. We use SSL VPN or client based VPN technology to provide users with secure connections.

Accounting relates to activity tracking in order to determine time spent on a specific system, amount of data used and failed and successful login attempts into a system.
