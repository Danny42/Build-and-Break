                        Habsburg's investment strategy is both disciplined and opportunistic. We try not to forget the guidelines that have led to past successes - but we also depart from tradition to pursue compelling opportunities. Our goal is to look for quality investment opportunities that excite us.
                    </p>
                    <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".7s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                        As a first success led to a second, and then a third, we developed a deep base of relevant industry knowledge.
                    </p>
                     <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".9s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                       We generally seek companies that are strong financial performers and market leaders, led by a highly motivated management team that wants to own, as well as run, the business.
                    </p>
					 <p  class="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay=".95s" data-wow-duration="500ms">
                      Our preference is for companies located in industries with favourable dynamics for sustainable earnings' growth which have resisted down cycles and show a compelling potential to improve margins and increase shareholder value.
